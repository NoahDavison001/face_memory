Core features:
    1. load and display random face images
    2. ask user if theyve seen the face before
    3. track faces the user has already seen
    4. give immediate feedback
    5. keep score / stats


Functional components:
    - image loader
    - seen tracker
    - UI 
    - Storage of results during a session
    - main loop


UI (simplistic for now):
+---------------------------+
|     [ IMAGE DISPLAY ]    |
|                           |
|  Have you seen this face? |
|  [ Yes ]     [ No ]       |
|  [Feedback: Correct/Wrong]|
|  Score: X correct / Y seen|
+---------------------------+

Flow:
    1. load app and start session
    2. show first image 
    3. user clicks yes or no
    4. compare answer to 'seen' list
    5. give feedback (correct/incorrect)
    6. if not seen, add to 'seen' list
    7. repeat


functions:
    main() - controls app Flow
    load_images() - loads all image paths
    show_image() - displays image in UI
    get_user_response() - gets user's yes/no input
    check_seen() - checks if image is in seen list
    log_Seen() - adds image to 'seen' list
    give_feedback() - displays whether correct or incorrect
    
- next button and remove feedback
- random order of photos, not just going down the list
- fix ui glitchiness and look
- colourful feedback
- access larger database

- section database to ensure some repetition
-   increase repetition rate depending on success rate
-   remove 'mastered' faces from database after successful spaced recognitions
-   show eg. '18/96 seen'



repetition rate of increase:
- start with 10 images in active pool, not repeated within 3 images.
- <25, every 4 answers add another face into active pool
- 25-75, new face every 3 answers
- 75+, new face every 2 answers
