UI (simplistic for now):

|     [ IMAGE DISPLAY ]    |
|                           |
|  Have you seen this face? |
|  [ Yes ]     [ No ]       |
|  [Feedback: Correct/Wrong]|
|  Score: X correct / Y seen|
+---------------------------+

Flow:
    1. load app and start session
    2. show first image 
    3. user clicks yes or no
    4. compare answer to 'seen' list
    5. give feedback (correct/incorrect)
    6. if not seen, add to 'seen' list
    7. repeat
